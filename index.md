### Telecom Churn Prediction - Kaggle Competition
**Objective :** In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another.To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, customer-level data of a leading telecom firm is analyzed and predictive models arebuild to identify customers at high risk of churn.

**Technology :** EDA Techniques, Data Visualization, Outlier Treatment, PCA, Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with Hyperparameter Tuning, Decision Trees with Hyperpameter Tuning, Random Forest with Hyperparameter Tuning

### Gesture Recognition 
**Objective :** You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

1. Thumbs up:  Increase the volume 
2. Thumbs down: Decrease the volume 
3. Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds 
4. Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
5. Stop: Pause the movie

This should be done by using the CNN/RNN architectures

**Technology :** CNN + RNN Architecture, 3D Convolutional Network, Generators, Transfer Learning, Image Processing

### House Price Predcition using Regression Techcniques
**Objective :**  There is a need to create a model for a US-based housing company named Surprise Housing so that they can look at prospective properties to buy to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. There is a need to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

**Technology :** EDA Techniques - Data Cleaning, Outlier Treatment, Correlation Matrix, Categorical data processing using dummies, Linear Regression using RFE, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression

### Melanoma Detection
**Objective :** There is a need to build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. This model can help in early detection of Melanoma.

**Technology :** EDA Techniques, Data Visualization, CNN Model building with appropriate optimizer & loss function, Data Augmentation, Handling class imbalances, Final CNN Model builing

### Automatic Ticket Classification 
**Objective :** Create a model that can automatically classify customer complaints based on the products and services that the ticket mentions. customer complaints are unstructured text data; so, traditionally, companies need to allocate the task of evaluating and assigning each ticket to the relevant department to multiple support employees. Build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services.

**Technology :** EDA Techniques, Data Visualization, Topic Modelling. Model building using Supervised learning. Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Naive Bayes
